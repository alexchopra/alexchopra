**A little about me:**
- Born in Orlando, Florida - Winter Park to be precise. My parents are both immigrants (My mom is from Poland and my dad is from India)
- I grew up playing soccer competitively (traveled all over the U.S. and a few countries abroad doing so), although I love all sports. I'm a competative person - I hate to lose.
- Attended Rollins College and graduated with a degree in Business & Economics
- Joined an Orlando-based fintech startup out of college. 

ðŸš§ðŸ‘· - The rest is currently under construction
